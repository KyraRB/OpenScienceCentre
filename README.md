# OpenScienceCentre
A project to inspire, empower &amp; engage citizens with Science &amp; Technology.

Our goal is facilitate the development of OpenScienceCentres in all the communities, as a place to connect with Science & Technology and contribute to their sustainable development. To make this goal true, we have three levels of resources. It starts with a digital content, where you will find everything that you can need for build your own OSC. For those who doesn't have the time or tools for the DIY step, but have already an empty space in their communities, we will provide the science kits and furniture needed to assemble your OSC. Finally, we have designed a full fledge OpenScienceCentre, that enable the further communities to own it in an easy and quick way.
